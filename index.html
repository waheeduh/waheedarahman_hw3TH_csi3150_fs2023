    <p>Junji Ito’s career in horror manga really took off
         in the mid-’80s when he submitted a horror short story 
         to a magazine called Monthly Halloween. 
         That story was later serialized as Tomie, 
         a manga that would end up running for 13 years. 
         Inspired by the tragic death of one of his classmates, 
         Ito wrote Tomie to explore death and mortality. 
         “It just felt so odd to me that a classmate 
         who was so full of life should suddenly disappear 
         from the world,” Ito told Grape. 
         “And I had the strange feeling that he
          would show up again innocently. 
          Ever since then, I wanted to give expression to that 
          feeling in my manga.” Tomie would go on to win the 
          Kazuo Umezu Prize in 1989 and was later 
          adapted into a series of horror films from 
          between 1999 and 2011.</p>
